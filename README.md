# Ncurses module for Swift

This is the result of the discussion held at https://forums.swift.org/t/ncurses-on-linux-with-swift/16913. It incorporates Ncurses into Swift, as well as the panel and menu headers. This package is SPM compatible and is tested under Linux. Finally, it is ready to be added into marathon too, with `marathon add lf-araujo/CNCURSES`.
